FEITO:
    install vitest (com dom e user events)
    install prop types
    install router


CONSIDER:
    - testing component rendering, updating, logic, etc ANNDDDDD user interactions
    - using prop types/default prop values on components
    - using "styled-components" (CSS in JS) OR Tailwind (CSS framework) - just to get a feel of how is it like to write CSS "outside the vanilla way"
